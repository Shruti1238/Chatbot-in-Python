# 🤖 ROBO - An Intelligent NLP-Based Chatbot

A sophisticated Python chatbot built from scratch using Natural Language Processing (NLTK) and machine learning techniques. ROBO can engage in conversations, answer queries about chatbots, and demonstrate advanced text processing capabilities.

## ✨ Features

- Natural language understanding using NLTK
- Intelligent response generation using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Contextual greeting detection
- Text preprocessing including tokenization, lemmatization, and noise removal
- Customizable knowledge base through text corpus

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- TfidfVectorizer for text vectorization
- Cosine Similarity for response matching

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robo-chatbot.git
cd robo-chatbot
```

2. Install the required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the chatbot
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## 💡 How It Works

ROBO uses several NLP techniques to understand and respond to user queries:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: 
   - Tokenization of sentences and words
   - Lemmatization to reduce words to their base form
   - Removal of punctuation and stop words

2. **Response Generation**:
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization
   - Cosine similarity matching for finding relevant responses
   - Greeting detection using keyword matching

3. **Conversation Flow**:
   - Maintains context during conversations
   - Handles greetings and farewells naturally
   - Provides graceful responses for unknown queries
